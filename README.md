## Task 1
    - Created a file named`arrayManipulation.js`.
- Added a function `processArray` that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.

## Task 2
    - In`arrayManipulation.js`, added a function `formatArrayStrings` that takes an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by`processArray`.
- The function modifies each string based on its corresponding number: capitalizes the entire string if the number is even, converts the string to lowercase if the number is odd.
-Updated arrayManipulation.js with formatArrayStrings function
